In this application, the user would be able to 
search for a song present in their phone storage. 
They would be able to play, pause, and stop a 
song. Your application will fetch all the songs from 
phone storage and will display it in the form of a 
list. It will take input from the user and search 
accordingly. 
By building this project, you’ll learn how to work 
with background services because the music 
application would be running in the background 
along with other apps. 
So, your music app should be run as a background 
thread. You’ll also learn how to provide 
notifications with play, pause, previous song, and 
next song buttons. 
Tools/ language required – Android Studio, Java 
or Kotlin, XML.
